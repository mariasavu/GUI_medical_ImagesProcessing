# GUI_medical_ImagesProcessing
While working on my diploma project, I realized that there was a need for pre-processing medical images to facilitate diagnosis for radiologists. My project focuses on taking DICOM files and displaying them in a user-friendly GUI. Users can apply various transformations to the images, such as adjusting contrast, brightness, and sharpness. They can also annotate the images and perform automatic segmentation on pulmonary CT scans.

The application was developed using Python 3.8 in Visual Studio Code, with tkinter used for GUI implementation. I have included a demo of the app to showcase its functionality and features.
